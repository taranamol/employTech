              <h2 class="">About Us</h2>  
              <p class="padding50">The lack of diversity amongst America’s key decision makers, and its pipeline of leadership talent is acute. </br></br> Employtech is designed to level the playing field for marginalized students, realize their leadership potential and increase representation amongst business and community decision-makers</p>
              
              <h4>For Students</h4>

              <p>“It's a privilege to be part of the Employtech community at Cal. I walk away with gems of information every week and have a much better sense on how to prepare for a successful life after graduation.” </br> -L. Matute, Employtech Fellow</p>

              <p class="bolded">Employtech provides nontraditional students with the necessary tools and support to launch them on a path to leadership </p>

              <p>We focus on high potential students who are low income, first generation college, or system-impacted and have overcome barriers that made completing their education seem near impossible. Our Fellows are equipped with access to the hidden curriculum and resources that underserved students are often unaware of, thus given the opportunity to experience the upward mobility that higher education can provide.</p>

              <p>Employtech Fellows are expected to contribute to the social and economic development of their own communities. This is done by helping to bridge the opportunity divide through use of the leadership skills and networks that they have gained.</p>
                            
              <hr class="bottom-line">

              <h4>For Employers</h4>

              <p>“We are incredibly fortunate to have a partner like Employtech and we look forward to building our relationship over time. We recruited a new team member, Siya, through Employtech and she has contributed immediately to our team, with passion, critical thinking, and a people-centered mindset.” </br>
              -Graham Gardner, Civil Labs</p>

              <p class="bolded">We’re seeking organizations like yours that want to build a diverse pipeline of leadership </p>

              <p>Employers today face the challenge of finding college graduates whose exposure to applied learning experiences enable problem-solving through collaboration, research, and community engagement in order to be effective in the workplace. </p>

              <p>Adding diversity compounds this challenge, but the benefits are great as it improves business performance. Studies prove that it increases creativity, innovation and problem solving, customer orientation and employee satisfaction, thus leading to an ongoing cycle of increasing returns (McKinsey Report, 2015 ).</p>

              <p>Working with Employtech provides employers with diverse leadership talent by selecting, mentoring, and preparing nontraditional students for the professional world.  This includes a range of underrepresented students that are transfers, re-entry, veterans and student parents, who offer a wealth of perspectives. </p>

              <p>Our employee partners are helping us level the playing field for students, increasing pathways towards representation and upward mobility for all.</p>
         
              <hr class="bottom-line">

              <h4>For Universities</h4>

              <p>“Employtech is a dynamic and successful model for providing underrepresented UC Berkeley students with a pathway to jobs matching their skills and leadership abilities. It is a critical key to ensuring that they experience a more leveled playing field.” </br> -D. Stark, Executive Director-Stiles Hall</p>

              <p class="bolded">Employtech is seeking to improve the economic and social outcomes of higher education among students that come from underserved populations.</p>

              <p>Low income student enrollment has dropped over the past 15 years because “elite” public universities are “not serving as many low-income students as they should” (Equality for Opportunity Project). In fact, the only UC to make the Upward Mobility Top 10 is University of California, Irvine. With State funding down 18% per student, it is increasingly important that these institutions embrace private sector initiatives that are bottom-up and represent the economic diversity of the communities that they reside in. </p>

              <p>Through our Community Outreach Initiative, Employtech Fellows are trained to connect with students on community college and low-income high school campuses as ambassadors to existing programs, such as Stiles Hall’s Experience Berkeley initiative, a non-profit organization that triples the admit rate of black, Latino and Native American community college students to UC Berkeley every year. The goal is to promote awareness through workshops and advising, leading to an increase in qualified underserved applicants and a strengthening of the relationship between the institutions, students and these organizations. </p>
